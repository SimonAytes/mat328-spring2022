## Description

This respository holds all homeworks, labs, and projects for the _MAT 328: Techniques in Data Science_ course. The description for the course (as included on the syllabus) can be found below:

> Analyzing data sets to extract new insights. Acquisition, data mining, storage, and visualization of real world data using scripting and statistical programming languages. Application of standard statistical tools including hypothesis testing, Bayesian analysis, bootstrapping and regression. Classifying and clustering multidimensional data sets via dimensionality reduction and machine learning techniques. 

## Topics Covered

_The homework and lab Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the corresponding folder in the `day-by-day-content` directory within this repository._

## Term Project

### Overview

The term project for this course (contained in the subdirectory called `mat328-term-project`) involved sourcing, cleaning, modeling, and evaluating data with various machine learning techniques covered in the course. Though the project's code lives on GitHub, a formal write-up can be found [HERE](https://sites.google.com/aytes.net/saytes-io/mat-328-term-project?authuser=0).

### Abstract

> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 12 million people die every year as a result of heart disease. In the United States, heart disease (HD) is the leading cause of death with 696,962 HD-related deaths occurring in 2020 alone. 
>
> My project evaluates two classification methods for their application in predicting the 10-year HD outcome of participants in the Framingham Study (n = 4,238).
